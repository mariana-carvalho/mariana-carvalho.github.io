I am a Ph.D. student in Political Science at University of California, San Diego.

I am mostly interested in the intersection between political economy of development and violence. My research focuses on causes and consequences of political violence, politics of crime, and corruption.

Prior to entering UCSD, I received a B.A. in Economics and a M.A. in Public Administration from Fundação Getulio Vargas, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. I've worked as a consultant for UN-Habitat, monitoring and evaluating several annual policy goals of the City Hall of Rio de Janeiro.
