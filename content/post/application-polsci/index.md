## Other advices

While I try to provide some advice, people way more experienced have done that before:

[Drezner’s article about political science PhD programs](https://foreignpolicy.com/2012/03/18/so-you-want-to-get-into-a-political-science-ph-d-program-episode-i/) 


Several source for Economics that can be useful for Political Scientists: 
- [Christian’s memo about the application process (recent, but overwhelming)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QozD6_4_bvMd2o-q-yh9Doc5aQ6i3nPV/view)
- [Gentzkow and Shapiro’s RA manual](https://github.com/gslab-econ/ra-manual/wiki/PhD-Application)
- [Blattman’s FAQ on PhD Applications](https://chrisblattman.com/about/contact/gradschool/)
- [Mankiw’s advice on choosing a graduate program (very Econ)](https://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2010/03/choosing-graduate-program.html)

This is a work in progress, please let me know if you have questions/comments/suggestions. And good luck!
