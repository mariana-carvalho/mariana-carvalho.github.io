I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at Brown University. I received my Ph.D. in Political Science at University of California, San Diego. My research interests lie in Political Economy and Comparative Politics, with a focus on the study of Violence and Crime. 

For the 2021-22 academic year, I was selected as a [Harry F Guggenheim Emerging Scholar](https://www.hfg.org/). In the 2020-2021 academic year, I was a [Dissertation Fellow with the UC Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation (IGCC)](https://igcc.ucsd.edu/funding/who-igcc-funds/fellows.html). My dissertation research and field work has been supported by the [2020-2021 NSF/APSA Dissertation Research Improvement Grant](https://www.apsanet.org/PROGRAMS/Doctoral-Dissertation-Research-Improvement-Grants), the UCSD Sanford Lakoff Research Fellowship, and the UCSD International Institute. 

Prior to entering UCSD, I received a B.A. in Economics and a M.A. in Public Administration from Fundação Getulio Vargas, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. I worked as a consultant for UN-Habitat, monitoring and evaluating several annual policy goals of the City Hall of Rio de Janeiro.

I have co-founded [A Ponte](https://redeaponte.com.br/), a network of women from academia and the public sector focused on supporting elected women. Our goal is to promote evidence-based policies and strengthen role models to attract more women to politics in Brazil.
