# My research focuses on political and criminal violence, illicit markets, public security, and non-state governance in Latin America

---

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at University of California, San Diego. My research lies in political economy of conflict and development, with a focus on criminal and political violence. 

In the 2020-2021 academic year, I will be a [Dissertation Fellow with the UC Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation](https://igcc.ucsd.edu/funding/who-igcc-funds/fellows.html). My dissertation research and field work has been supported by the [2020-2021 NSF/APSA Dissertation Research Improvement Grant](https://www.apsanet.org/PROGRAMS/Doctoral-Dissertation-Research-Improvement-Grants), the UCSD Sanford Lakoff Research Fellowship, and the UCSD International Institute. 

Prior to entering UCSD, I received a B.A. in Economics and a M.A. in Public Administration from Fundação Getulio Vargas, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. I worked as a consultant for UN-Habitat, monitoring and evaluating several annual policy goals of the City Hall of Rio de Janeiro.

I have co-founded [A Ponte](https://redeaponte.com.br/), a network of women from academia and the public sector focused on supporting elected women. Our goal is to promote evidence-based policies and strengthen role models to attract more women to politics in Brazil.
